### Overview

Utility for generating launchers for Java-based applications across Windows,
Linux, and Mac OSX. Unlike other "service wrappers", this utility can create
simple console launchers (shell/batch) as well as daemon wrappers using standard
OS utilities or third-party libraries.

While other Java service wrappers attempt to handle re-spawning via a secondary
controller process, what about relatively simple console apps / daemons or
an interest in using better tools for handling re-spawning like monit.
